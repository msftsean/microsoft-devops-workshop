# Benefits of Containers

*Note: The following is loosly based on content found on the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/what-container), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), and various other locations.*

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings, etc. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure.

<dl>
  <dt>Lightweight</dt>
  <dd>Docker containers running on a single machine share that machine's operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less compute and RAM. Images are constructed from filesystem layers and share common files. This minimizes disk usage and image downloads are much faster.</dd>

  <dt>Standard</dt>
  <dd>Docker containers are based on open standards and run on all major Linux distributions, Microsoft Windows, and on any infrastructure including VMs, bare-metal and in the cloud.</dd>

  <dt>Secure</dt>
  <dd>Docker containers isolate applications from one another and from the underlying infrastructure. Docker provides the strongest default isolation to limit app issues to a single container instead of the entire machine.</dd>
</dl>

As actions are done to a Docker base image, union file-system layers are created and documented, such that each layer fully describes how to recreate an action. This strategy enables Docker's lightweight images, as only layer updates need to be propagated (compared to full VMs, for example).

Building on top of facilities provided by the Linux kernel (primarily cgroups and namespaces), a Docker container, unlike a virtual machine, does not require or include a separate operating system. Instead, it relies on the kernel's functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory, and separate namespaces to isolate the application's view of the operating system. Docker accesses the Linux kernel's virtualization features directly using the `libcontainer` library (written in the Go programming language).

## Comparing Containers and Virtual Machines

Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient.

<dl>
  <dt>Virtual Machines</dt>
  <dd>Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, one or more apps, necessary binaries and libraries &mdash; taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot.</dd>

  <dt>Containers</dt>
  <dd>Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), and start almost instantly.</dd>

## Docker Components

The Docker software as a service offering consists of three components:

<dl>
  <dt>Software</dt>
  <dd>The Docker daemon, called <code>dockerd</code>, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects. The daemon listens for API requests sent by the Docker Engine API. The Docker client, which identifies itself as <code>docker</code>, allows users to interact with Docker through CLI. It uses the Docker REST API to communicate with one or more Docker daemons.</dd>

  <dt>Objects</dt>
  <dd>Docker objects refer to different entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main Docker objects are images, containers, and services.
  <ul>
    <li>A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications. A container is managed using the Docker API or CLI.</li>
    <li>A Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications.</li>
    <li>A Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a "swarm"; cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API.</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Registries</dt>
  <dd>A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries to download ("pull") images for use or upload ("push") images that they have built. Registries can be public or private. The two main public registries are [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/). Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images.</dd>
